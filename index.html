    <h2>4. Data Types In JavaScript</h2>
    <p>There are 7 data types in JS 
        We have Primitive Data Types, and the data types which are not primitive are Objects.
        <h4>Note: Objects is the King of the Castle</h4>
        As per Primitive Data Types we have : 
            1. String
            2. Numbers
            3. Boolean
            4. Null (Which essentially shows up nothing)
            5. Undefined
            6. Symbol (ES6)
        And in Objects we have :
            1.Arrays
            2. Functions
            3. Objects
        We have an Operator in JavaScript that is <b>typeof</b> operator
        <b>typeof:</b> It is an operator which spitsback the type of the operator or the data type
