//LET vs VAR vs CONST

//var(The Value assigned using var can be changed)
var val = 100;
//let(The Value which is assigned using let can be changed)
let firstname="Phil";
//const(In Const we cant change the Value)
const lastname = "Mark";



//Example(Let us assume an address of a person)
var name="Tommy"; //Name can be assigned as var which can be changed depending on the owner
let zip="583201"; //ZIP code can be considered to be let since the same address can be present in another city too..!!
const address="#543 4th Main 9th Avenue CA USA" // I have given address as Const becuase to the given zip code that is the only address which is valid it can't be changed..!!
console.log(val);
console.log(firstname);
console.log(lastname);
console.log(name);
console.log(zip);
console.log(address);
